@article{Goppl2008,
abstract = {We have designed and fabricated superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators with fundamental frequencies from 2 to \$9 \backslash rm\{GHz\}\$ and loaded quality factors ranging from a few hundreds to a several hundred thousands reached at temperatures of \$20 \backslash rm\{mK\}\$. The loaded quality factors are controlled by appropriately designed input and output coupling capacitors. The measured transmission spectra are analyzed using both a lumped element model and a distributed element transmission matrix method. The experimentally determined resonance frequencies, quality factors and insertion losses are fully and consistently characterized by the two models for all measured devices. Such resonators find prominent applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing with superconducting electronic circuits and in single photon detectors and parametric amplifiers.},
